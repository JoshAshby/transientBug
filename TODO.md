- whoosh searching of notes
- better tag searching for phots and notes (maybe time to break out whoosh for
  both?)
- management & error viewing page for daemons (have loogging to rethink with
  various client info for all error pages working)
- integrate python side of my irssi-utils stuff
 - push messages into rethink and make a controller to view
     add support for json retrieval (more on this later)
- user invites, registration (? thinking about this and still unsure of the use
  for this so far, we'll see)
- better email views
- Custom themes for slideshows?
