- management & error viewing page for daemons
- integrate python side of my irssi-utils stuff
 - push messages into rethink and make a controller to view
     add support for json retrieval?
- better email views
- Rewrite of ACL (this goes for seshat_addons too) for finer control.
- rewrite of nav: directive for templates
- rewrite of seshat_addons.template to use jinja, requires rewriting a lot of
  the partial template stuff and a few other things but should be well worth it
  now that everything is using jinja
- stats about things? eh
