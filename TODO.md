# TODONOWTHINGS
- better email views
- Rewrite of ACL (this goes for seshat_addons too) for finer control.
- rewrite of nav: directive for templates
- clean up unused code, like all the daemon stuff

# Ideas
- error viewing page for things
- integrate python side of my irssi-utils stuff
 - push messages into rethink and make a controller to view them
- stats about things? eh
- Ditch lazyloader? don't really need it and it just makes pages slower and
  messy
- look into component for managing client side stuff? looks nicer than bower
  and doesn't just do a git clone like bower
